# HowLongToBeatYourSteamLibrary
Python script that uses an API to howlongtobeat.com and Steam to find every game in your steam library, get the time it takes to beat in hours and saves it that to a csv file

To run the script:
1. install Python 3
2. Run "Python -m pip install -r [path_to_requirements.txt]" in cmd/terminal
3. Run "MakeHTLBcsv.py [your_steam_id]" in cmd/terminal

Check the output log for any missing games or games that the search got wrong (as it sometimes finds a different game if the title is very simple/short)
